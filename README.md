# greenland_account

A demographic account for Greenland, containing population, births, deaths, immigration, and emigration. The account is not internally consistent, though it could be made consistent using a function such as `estimateModel` in package **demest**. We demonstrate how including Lexis triangles in the account allows us to switch between different views of the data.
